## Project Overview

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior.
- Identified key predictors among 13 features, such as **Credit History**, **Balance Income**, and **Loan Amount**.
- Applied preprocessing techniques like **missing value imputation**, **outlier detection**, and **feature engineering**.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

‚úÖ Achieved an **average accuracy of ~75%** with Random Forest performing the best.
